web 1.0vs 2.0 vs 3.0
Which transaction should go into the ledger?
Can we trust transaction history?
make history of transaction immutable.
1.caesar cipher m->encrypt->cipher we can get back original data.
Blockchain uses hashing. to get message back computing power is more (almost imposssible)
Block Nonce Hash Blockchain
Distributed Blockchain
Ethereum-storing code on blocks

Old way->Build a company raise VC funding IpO cashout
New web 3 way:->Build release token for public to use dapp and raise money for your service from day1 DAO
Dropbox vs filecoin $6,000,000 vs $257,000,000(initial coin offering) Pseudonymity

Ethereum Problem->scaling:You cant store data on ethereum and costly to perform computation on ethereum.
NFTs which are minted on ethereum are not even stored on the blockchain.Instead what you get is the url and the actual data.
Images for NFts are often stored on a company's private server like the amazon web services.
Lot of DApps on ethereum are often patchwork of differeent services. all css,js ,images are hosted on aws.
ICP idea-to build a scalable cloud computer that runs on a blockchain
Allows fast computaions and allows you to directly store the data on the blockchain network.
transaction finality: update -2sec
query-ms
on chain  contract costs:$5/gb per year

Internet Computer: goal :to achieve blockchain singularity
Idea is to build a powerful secure blockchain capable of running entire base layer of the web.
Todays dapps are only partilaily decentralized majority of data are stored on web 2 company servers.
Etehereum -diificult to store large amount of data and computation
ICP aggergrates computing power of large number of data centers and combines them using ICP protocol into a large single decentralized world computer.
Icp->canister  canister can hold program and states using web assembly module and flat memeory module.
